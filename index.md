## Click Path, an open source HTML game

Click your way through the doors and make it to the end. The more levels you do, the harder the game gets. [Play.](https://xylogithub.github.io/click-path-game/play-game/levels/level-select.html)

### View the project


```markdown
You can view the open source code on the Github Repository, [here](https://github.com/xylogithub/click-path-game). Of course, It's new and the game does not work well, so that's why you can request your issues and a possible solution at the [issues tab](https://github.com/xylogithub/click-path-game/issues)
```
